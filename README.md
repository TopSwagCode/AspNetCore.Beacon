# What is it?
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Beacon_API/Using_the_Beacon_API

The Beacon interface schedules an asynchronous and non-blocking request to a web server.

Beacon requests use HTTP POST and do not require a response.
Beacon requests are guaranteed to be initiated before the page unloads.
This document contains examples of the Beacon interfaces. See Beacon API for an overview.

# Can I use it?

Yes! :)

# Alternatives

Google analytics.

# Further ideas

You could store session cookie with UID and track user from start to end.
Have a different table to store user identity if user login during their visit, so we can attach the logs to a given state.


# TODO

* More details in readme and images and memes :D
* Migrations run
* Guide how to run this project and how it was created
* Perhaps a blog post?
